# Markowitz-Portfolio-Optimization
Constructs portfolios to optimize expected return based on a given level of risk.
It is achieved through a monte carlo simulation that simulates X amount of portfolio allocations. From there we pick the 
portfolios that had the best return based on a given level of risk. 
Finally, the best portfolio is picked based on its sharpe ratio, or the tangent of the efficient frontier i.e. the plot below.
